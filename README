buildprocs

Background
This is a small shell based application which I wrote in the Summer 2010 semester at Villanova for my UNIX class.
I initially wrote it to automate some repetitive MySQL tasks and the application essentially grew from there.  Many
of the operations revolve around getting metadata from MySQL databases and tables.  

Core Functionality
We all know building CRUD stored procedures for database tables is quite a laborious process.  One of the tasks which
my application automates is generating stored procedures for a MySQL table.  It will generate stored procedures
for inserting, updating, deleting and returning data. 

In addtion to code generation, the script will give you a list of all tables in the database along with a row count,
metadata for a specific table, running SQL commands, and running ssytem commands.

Usage
Make sure you have mysql installed on the box where this shell script will be run. Then it's simply:

./buildprocs DB_NAME USERNAME PWD

The user is required to provide data for the database name, user name and password.
